# OCR Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **File Processing**:
   - The system shall accept image files in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` formats.
   - The system shall accept `.pdf` files for OCR processing.
   - The system shall throw an error if the file format is unsupported.

2. **OCR Text Recognition**:
   - The system shall extract text from supported image and PDF files using the OCR provider.
   - The system shall return the extracted text to the caller.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The system shall throw a `FileNotFound` error if the file does not exist.
   - The system shall throw an `UnsupportedFileType` error for unsupported file formats.
   - The system shall throw an `OcrError` if the OCR provider fails to process the file.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:
   - The OCR processing time for a single file shall not exceed 5 seconds under normal conditions.

2. **Scalability**:
   - The system shall support concurrent processing of up to 10 files.

3. **Reliability**:
   - The system shall maintain a 99.9% uptime for OCR services.

4. **Security**:
   - The system shall ensure that uploaded files are deleted after processing.

5. **Extensibility**:
   - The system shall allow integration with alternative OCR providers without modifying the `OcrService` class.
