# Quality Assurance (QA) Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the QA strategy for the Front Accounting Receipt Processor project. The goal is to ensure the system meets functional and non-functional requirements through rigorous testing and validation.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Objective**: Verify the functionality of individual modules.
- **Tools**: PHPUnit
- **Coverage**: All core modules, including:
  - FileWatcher
  - OcrService
  - ReceiptParser
  - SupplierMapper
  - ItemMapper
  - Currency
  - Units
  - SupplierService
  - ItemService
  - PriceTracker
  - UsageTracker
  - InvoiceBuilder
  - BudgetEstimator
  - FaClient

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure that modules interact correctly.
- **Tools**: PHPUnit
- **Coverage**: End-to-end workflows, including:
  - Receipt ingestion to invoice generation.
  - API interactions with Front Accounting.

### 3. System Testing
- **Objective**: Validate the system against requirements.
- **Tools**: Manual testing, PHPUnit
- **Coverage**: Full system workflows.

### 4. Regression Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Tools**: PHPUnit
- **Coverage**: All modules.

### 5. Performance Testing
- **Objective**: Assess the system's performance under load.
- **Tools**: Apache JMeter
- **Coverage**: OCR processing, API interactions.

## Test Environment
- **PHP Version**: 8.3
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Operating System**: Linux/Windows
- **Tools**: PHPUnit, Composer, Docker

## Test Reporting
- **Tool**: PHPUnit
- **Format**: HTML and XML reports
- **Frequency**: After each major feature implementation.

## Conclusion
This QA strategy ensures the Front Accounting Receipt Processor meets its functional and non-functional requirements, providing a robust and reliable system.
