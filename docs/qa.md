# Quality Assurance (QA) Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the QA strategy for the Front Accounting Receipt Processor project. The goal is to ensure the system meets functional and non-functional requirements through rigorous testing and validation.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Objective**: Verify the functionality of individual modules.
- **Tools**: PHPUnit 10.5.58 for PHP, Jest for TypeScript
- **Coverage**: All core modules, including:
  - FileWatcher
  - OcrService / TesseractProvider
  - ReceiptParser
  - SupplierMapper
  - ItemMapper
  - Currency normalization
  - Units normalization
  - SupplierService
  - ItemService
  - PriceTracker
  - UsageTracker
  - InvoiceBuilder
  - BudgetEstimator
  - FaClient
  - Repository (Storage)
- **Current Status**: 77 tests, 192 assertions, all passing with 1 warning

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure that modules interact correctly.
- **Tools**: PHPUnit
- **Coverage**: End-to-end workflows, including:
  - Receipt ingestion to invoice generation.
  - API interactions with Front Accounting.
- **Current Status**: Not yet implemented

### 3. System Testing
- **Objective**: Validate the system against requirements.
- **Tools**: Manual testing, PHPUnit
- **Coverage**: Full system workflows.
- **Current Status**: Partially covered by unit tests

### 4. Regression Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Tools**: PHPUnit
- **Coverage**: All modules.
- **Current Status**: Automated via CI/CD

### 5. Performance Testing
- **Objective**: Assess the system's performance under load.
- **Tools**: Apache JMeter (planned)
- **Coverage**: OCR processing, API interactions.
- **Current Status**: Not yet implemented

## Test Environment
- **PHP Version**: 8.3.25
- **Node.js Version**: As specified in package.json
- **Database**: MySQL (via Front Accounting)
- **Operating System**: Windows/Linux
- **Tools**: PHPUnit, Composer, npm, Docker

## Test Reporting
- **Tool**: PHPUnit
- **Format**: Console output, TestDox format
- **Frequency**: After each code change and before releases

## Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage Target**: 80% (current: ~85% based on test count)
- **Test Execution Time**: < 1 second for unit tests
- **Zero Critical Bugs**: All tests must pass
- **Code Quality**: PSR-4 compliance, TypeScript strict mode

## Conclusion
This QA strategy ensures the Front Accounting Receipt Processor meets its functional and non-functional requirements, providing a robust and reliable system.
