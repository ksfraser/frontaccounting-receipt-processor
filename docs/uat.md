- **AC5.3**: Invoices must be submitted to Front Accounting successfully

#### 6. API Integration
- **AC6.1**: System must authenticate with Front Accounting API
- **AC6.2**: All API calls must handle errors gracefully
- **AC6.3**: System must retry failed API calls
- **AC6.4**: Data synchronization must be bidirectional

#### 7. Error Handling
- **AC7.1**: System must log all errors appropriately
- **AC7.2**: Failed receipts must be quarantined for manual review
- **AC7.3**: System must continue processing other receipts on failure

## UAT Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Receipt Processing
**Preconditions**: System is running, receipt directory is monitored
**Steps**:
1. Place a valid receipt file in the monitored directory
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Check logs for successful processing
4. Verify supplier and items created in Front Accounting
5. Verify invoice generated and submitted

**Expected Results**: All steps complete successfully, data accurate

### Scenario 2: Invalid Receipt Handling
**Preconditions**: System is running
**Steps**:
1. Place an invalid/unreadable receipt file
2. Check error logs
3. Verify file is moved to error directory
4. Verify no invalid data is created

**Expected Results**: Error handled gracefully, no data corruption

### Scenario 3: Duplicate Item Handling
**Preconditions**: Item exists in system
**Steps**:
1. Process receipt with existing item
2. Verify price history is updated
3. Verify usage statistics are updated
4. Check no duplicate items created

**Expected Results**: Data merged correctly, no duplicates

### Scenario 4: API Failure Recovery
**Preconditions**: Front Accounting API is unavailable
**Steps**:
1. Process a receipt
2. Verify system retries API calls
3. Restore API connectivity
4. Verify data synchronization completes

**Expected Results**: System recovers from API failures

### Scenario 5: Bulk Processing
**Preconditions**: System is running
**Steps**:
1. Place multiple receipt files simultaneously
2. Monitor processing queue
3. Verify all receipts processed
4. Check system performance and stability

**Expected Results**: All receipts processed efficiently
